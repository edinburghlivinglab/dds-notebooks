    "So now we see that we have got a *time series*: a sequence of data points measured at different times &mdash; in this case, in successive years. The two columns have been given labels which tell us what the time points are, and what kind of quantity has been measured. We could also specify not just *when* but *where* the measurements were taken, namely in Edinburgh.\n",

    "## Turning Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "We often represent data in the form of rows and columns. That's what we mean when we talk about a data table (or tabular data). So the rainfall data above had two columns and eight rows, plus a header row.\n",

    "Public bodies collect *lots* of data about all manners of things. More and more, they have been making this available as [open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data ) to anyone that wants to use it. Most of the time, the data is provided as some kind of table that we can download over the internet. Here's an example of data about Scottish schools which we've already downloaded for you. We're doing a bit of extra magic to make it easy to display the data, but you can ignore this for the time being."
