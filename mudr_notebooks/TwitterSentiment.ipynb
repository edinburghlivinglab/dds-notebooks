    "# Sentiment Analysis for Twitter\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is going to introduce some simple tools for detecting sentiment in Tweets. We will be using a set of tools called the Natural Language Toolkit ([NLTK](http://www.nltk.org)). This is collection of software written in the [Python](https://www.python.org) programming language. An important design goal behind Python is that it should be easy to read and fun to use, so well-suited for beginners. A similar motivation inspired NLTK: it should make complex tasks easy to carry out, and it should be written in a way that would allow users to inspect and understand the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this relevant? Well, a lot of software these days is built to be easy to use, but hard to inspect. For example, smartphones have a lot of slick apps on them, but very few people have the expertise to look under the hood to find out how they work. NLTK has quite the opposite approach: you are actively encouraged to discover how the code works. However, your level of understanding will depend heavily on how far you get to grips with Python itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is written using the [Ipython](http://ipython.org) framework. This allows text to be interspersed by fragments of code, occuring in special \"cells\". Just below is a cell where we are using Python to do a simple calculation:"

    "## Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about understanding natural language, we often focus on 'who did what to whom'. Yet in many situations, we are more interested in attitudes and opinions. When someone writes about a movie, did they like it or hate it? Is a product review for a water bottle on Amazon positive or negative? Is a Tweet about the US President supportive\n",
    "or critical? We might also care about the intensity of the views expressed: \"this is a fine movie\" is different from \"WOW! This movie is soooooo great!!!!\" even though both are positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Sentiment analysis* (or *opinion mining*) is a broad term for a range of techniques that try to identify the subjective views expressed in texts. Many organisations care deeply about public opinion &mdash; whether these concern commercial products, creative works, or political parties and policies &mdash; and have consequently turned to sentiment analysis as a way of gleaning valuable insights from voluminous bodies of online text. This in turn has stimulated much activity in the area, ranging from academic research to commercial applications and industry-focussed conferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's worth saying at the outset that sentiment analysis is hard. Although it is designed to work with written text, the way in which people express their feelings is often goes far beyond what they literally say. In spoken language, intonation will be important. And of course we often express emotion using no words at all, as illustrated in this picture from Darwin's book *The Expression of the Emotions*.\n",

    "## Classifying sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we want to classify a sentence into one of three categories: **positive**, **negative** or\n",
    "**neutral**. Each of these can be illustrated by posts on Twitter collected during the UK General Election in 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "<dl>\n",
    "<dt>positive:</dt>\n",
    "<dd><i>Good stuff from Clegg. Clear, passionate & honest about the difficulties of govt but also the difference @LibDems have made.</i></dd>\n",
    "\n",
    "<dt>negative:</dt> \n",
    "<dd><i>Hmm. Ed Miliband being against SNP is a bad move  I think. It'll cost him n it is a dumb choice.</i></dd>\n",
    "\n",
    "<dt>neutral:</dt> \n",
    "<dd><i>Why is Ed Milliband trending when him name is Ed Miliband?</i></dd>\n",
    "</dl>\n",
    "\n",
    "The term **polarity** is often used to refer to whether a piece of text is judged to be positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest approach to classifying examples like these is to get hold of two lists of words, positive ones such as *good*, *excellent*, *fine*, *triumph*, *well*, *succeed*, ... and negative ones such as *bad*, *poor*, *dismal*,\n",
    "*lying*, *fail*, *disaster*, .... We figure out an overall polarity score based on the ratio of positive tokens to negative ones in a given string. A sentence with neither positive or negative tokens (or possibly an equal number of each) will be categorised as neutral. This simple approach is likely to yield the roughly correct results for the Twitter examples above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things become more complicated when negation enter into the picture. The next example is mildly positive (at least in British English), so we need to ensure that *not* reverses the polarity of *bad* in appropriate contexts,\n",

    "\n",
    "[VADER](http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/icwsm14.vader.hutto.pdf) is a system for determining the sentiment of texts which has been incorporated into NLTK. It is based on the idea of looking for positive and negative words, but adds to important new elements. First, it uses a lexicon of 7,500 items which have been manually annotated for both polarity and intensity. Second, the overall score for an input text is computed by using a complex set of rules that take into account not just words (and negation), but also the boosting effect of devices like capitalisation and punctuation."
