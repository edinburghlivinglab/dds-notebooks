# IPython Notebooks for Data, Design and Society

## Overview

These notebooks are intended for a new undergraduate course at the University of Edinburgh called [Data, Design and Society](http://edin.ac/1KukGVu).


## Bokeh / Ipython set-up:

The project is currently set up as a Python package.  Within a virtual environment
it can be globally installed from its root directory with the following command:

```
% pip install -e .
```

This sets up all the dependencies required to run Bokeh in conjunction with IPython notebooks.
