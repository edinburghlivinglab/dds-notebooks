# IPython Notebooks for Data, Design and Society

## Bokeh / Ipython set-up:

The project is currently set up as a Python package.  Within a virtual enviroment
it can be globally installed from its root directory with the following command:

```
% pip install -e .
```

This sets up all the dependencies required to run Bokeh in conjunction with IPython notebooks.
