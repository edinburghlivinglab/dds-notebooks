# JupyterHub as an OER Platwform

We have been experimenting with cross-disciplinary courses at both the undergraduate and Masters level, adopting a blended learning approach: face-to-face, real-time engagements will be supported by a variety of computer-mediated learning materials. One of our important goals is to help students with little or no programming experience to become comfortable with basic data analysis and visualisation tasks. This has led us to
 to experiment with a framework based on [iPython](http://ipython.org) and [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyterhub). This approach has several attractive features:

* it offers a browser-based 'notebook' with support for rich text, executable code blocks and interactive data visualisation;
* it allows students to receive the same learning materials but experiment with them on an individual basis within a standardised environment;
* the components are all open source and actively maintained;
* since the platform is made available as a service, students are not required to download and install the necessary software; in additions we are able to ensure that all required libraries are present, together with any customisations that we want to make available.
