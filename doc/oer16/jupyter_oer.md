# JupyterHub as an OER Platwform

As part of Edinburgh Living Lab, we have been experimenting with cross-disciplinary courses at both the undergraduate ([Data, Design and Society](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/15-16/dpt/cxinfr08024.htm)) and Masters level ([Design for Informatics](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/15-16/dpt/cxdesi11027.htm)). 
We are sharing structure and content between the two courses as far as is compatible with their difference audience and learning outcomes

We are adopting a blended learning approach: face-to-face, real-time engagements will be supported by a variety of computer-mediated learning materials.

One of our important goals is to help students with little or no programming experience to become comfortable with basic data analysis and visualisation tasks. This has led us to
 to experiment with a framework based on [iPython](http://ipython.org), [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyterhub) and [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org). This approach has several attractive features:

* it offers a browser-based 'notebook' with support for rich text, executable code blocks and interactive data visualisation;
* it allows students to receive the same learning materials but experiment with them on an individual basis within a standardised environment;
* the components are all open source and actively maintained;
* since we would provide the platform via our own server, we would be able to ensure that all required Python libraries are present, together with any customisations that we want to make available.

We would like to get a trial service running on an Informatics self-managed server over the next month or so, and then discuss with IS the logistics of migrating the service to one of their services.
