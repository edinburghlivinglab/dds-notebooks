    "# What is data? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preamble\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces some basic ideas about data, and illustrates them with a number of examples of different types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does not require any prior background.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "So what *is* data? The term is used in so many ways, it's often hard to pin down what people mean. Here is what [Wikipedia says][data1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Data is uninterpreted information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is somewhat helpful, but also a bit cryptic, since we aren't told what it means to interpret information. Indeed, [it is often suggested](http://www.diffen.com/difference/Data_vs_Information) that an act of interpretation is required to go from data to information:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Data are the facts or details from which information is derived. Individual pieces of data are rarely useful alone. For data to become information, data needs to be put into context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a longer passage about 'raw data' from the Wikipedia [article on data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Raw data, i.e. unprocessed data, is a collection of numbers, characters; data processing commonly occurs by stages, and the \"processed data\" from one stage may be considered the \"raw data\" of the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is more useful, since it tells us that data can somehow be 'processed' and possibly transformed into something else &mdash; we'll see some examples of processing data as we go through this lesson.\n",
    "The Wikipedia article also points out that what counts as data is relative to the context. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to get a clearer picture by looking at some examples, involving both text and numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "[data1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(disambiguation)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Yesterday I ate tomatoes\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose I decide to keep a diary about the food I eat. This could be pretty informal, something a bit like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Monday\n",
    "------\n",
    "bfast: toast and jam\n",
    "lunch: tomato soup and roll\n",
    "supper: baked beans, sushi, treacle tart\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuesday\n",
    "-------\n",
    "bfast: porridge with soya milk\n",
    "lunch: tomato soup and roll\n",
    "supper: peri-peri chicken, chips, coke\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite being informal, it's still good enough to count as data about my diet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think briefly what we could do with this data. One possibility is that we could try to identify each of the dishes and categorise them by ingredient, say in terms of grains, pulses, meat, spices and so on. Categorising the data items in this way would be one example of *processing* data. Earlier on, we talked about data \"being transformed into something eles\". In this example, the \"something else\" might be an answer to the question: Do I have a balanced diet?\n",
    "\n",
    "## I run\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a slightly different kind of diary, recording my running exploits in the first half of December:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "5/12/15 4.5km\n",
    "7/12/15 3.1km\n",
    "12/12/15 8.6km\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So here we have data that combines two types of information: dates and distances. It's important to know that these are different kinds of data elements. For example, we know that we can add together the three distances, to get a total of 16.2km. By contrast, trying to just add the dates together to get a total doesn't make sense (although we could do something more fancy to find out the total number of days covered by the diary).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Just numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "What about this <a id=\"simple_numbers\"></a>list of numbers?\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "23.87\n",
    "19.85\n",
    "19.22\n",
    "28.93\n",
    "29.41\n",
    "22.23\n",
    "23.50\n",
    "24.95\n",
    "```\n",
    "Who knows? Apart from the fact that the numbers are in a narrow range, it's pretty much impossible to guess what this information is about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the same numbers, but with more information added:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Year   Days of rainfall\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "2004        23.87\n",
    "2005        19.85\n",
    "2006        19.22\n",
    "2007        28.93\n",
    "2008        29.41\n",
    "2009        22.23\n",
    "2010        23.50\n",
    "2011        24.95\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we see that we have got a *time series*: a sequence of data points measured at different times &mdash; in this case, in successive years. The two columns have been given labels which tell us what the time points are, and what kind of quantity has been measured. We could also specify not just *when* but *where* the measurements were taken, namely in Edinburgh.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rainfall data is **objective** in the sense that it's the result of an observer measuring physical quantities. Ideally, two different observers taking the same measurements would record the same data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we know more about the data, we can think of ways of processing it. For example, we could:\n",
    "\n",
    "* round all the numbers to integers\n",
    "* find the average rainfall over the eight years\n",
    "* find the years with the minimum and maximum rainfall\n",
    "\n",
    "and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The information which tells us things like dates, location, the kind of quantity etc is sometimes called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata\">metadata</a>: it's data about data.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Play around with different ways of 'processing' the rainfall data along the lines suggested above.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find another example of time series data. Find or make-up some data points that are part of the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find another <a href=\"#simple_numbers\">list of numbers</a> like the one above which is *not* time series data. What metadata would have to be present to make sure that someone else understands what the data is about?"
