    "# Iterations and Relationships in Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen in previous tutorials [Playing with python](playing_with_python.ipynb) a bit about sequential data structures such as lists and how we can use them to store a set of numbers, words and other type of object. In this tutorial we will examine how to go through sequential data structures in order to combine their contents to obtain a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loops\n",
    "Loops are statements which allow us to iterate (go through) the elements insice a list. By this I mean say I have the following attendance list for a school\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Student   Absence\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "John        yes\n",
    "Paul        no\n",
    "Kate        yes\n",
    "Catriona    yes\n",
    "Peter       no\n",
    "Alex        yes\n",
    "Jordan      no\n",
    "William     yes\n",
    "```\n",
    "And I want to find out the percentage of students absent for the record given above. To do that I have to scan through the list and count the number of \"no's\" out of the total number of students. The process of scanning through the list is a form of looping. In this example we have 3 out of 8 students absent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Loops\n",
    "These are the most simple and used type of loops. They have a general structure of:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# loop statement:\n",
    "for element in list_of_elements:\n",
    "    # Loop body (things done to the element like counting the\n",
    "    # no's happen here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that they pull out every element in a list of elements in our example above (the table of students) the first iteration of the loop would pull out `John, yes` the third iteration would pull out `Kate, yes` and the sixth iteration would pull out ?"
